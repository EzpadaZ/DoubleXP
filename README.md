# DoubleXP Plugin
DoubleXP is a Minecraft Plugin for Spigot compatible servers running version 1.20     
It won't be tested for previous versions as i just mantain a single server running it, and will update it
with every iteration moving forwards.

It is very simple, paired with another plugin like RealisticSeasons to enable it during certain days
certainly adds to the game, i made this so i could do that because i didn't find anything close to it.

## Features

- /dxp {enable | disable}   || enables or disables the 2XP, only triggers from console.
- /dxp get || displays your current total EXP points.
- /dxp status || displays if the 2XP is currently active or not.
- /dxp optin || displays in-game how much XP you get from everything that drops an EXP Orb.
- /dxp optout || disables the above display.

## Config File

- log: true   || This allows for the optin/optout XP display.
- multiplier: 2 || How much the received XP will be multiplied for.
